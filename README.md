#### Project Overview
The goal was to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic. I chose some tricky questions about the world as the topic for this app. The app presents 8 quiz questions. The questions may ask to choose one answer from a group of radio buttons, multiple answers from a group of check boxes, or type in an answer. Upon submitting the answers, the score is calculated and displayed through ... along with the correct/incorrect answers.
